					At some point when we have a more compiled list, Enkindu or I will merge it all into the top post as an easy to use reference. And we'll try and make it pretty somehow, heh.<br />
 <br />
For now, though, I just figure I'll add what I've been using.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-size: large"><b>Normalhit Combos</b></span><br />
 <br />
1{K], 2B+K, K --- 53 damage<br />
 <br />

 <br />
A+B~3 CR BB----56 damage<br />
 <br />
1K, 66B BE --- 59 damage, 1/2 bar meter<br />
 <br />
66K, Critical Edge, MCHT K --- 80 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
66B BE 66B BE --- 86 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
666 B, 66B BE, 66B BE- 94 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
44B, BS 6BB, 66B BE --- 95-96 damage, 1/2 bar meter<br />
 <br />
<b><span style="font-size: large">Normalhit Combos starting from Blindstance</span></b><br />
 <br />
BS 8WR B, K --- 52 damage<br />
 <br />
BS 4K, 44K, 8WR B--- 63 damage, 69 damage on clean hit<br />
 <br />
BS CR/WS B, 4K, 4A --- 72 damage<br />
 <br />
BS 8WR B, 666B, 66B, 666B --- 76 damage<br />
 <br />
BS CR/WS B, 4K, 44K 8WR B --- 81 damage, 86 on cleanhit<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-size: large"><b>Wallcombos</b></span><br />
 <br />
1K w! 1K w! {B+K} MCHT K --- 69 damage<br />
 <br />
1K w! 1K w! 666B 66B 666B --- 73 damage<br />
 <br />
22_88B w! BS 4K w! 4K, 44K 2K --- 73 damage 76-78 damage on cleanhit<br />
 <br />
1K w! 1K w! 666B 66B 66B BE --- 81 damage, 1/2 bar meter<br />
 <br />
BS B+K w! 1K w! 666B 66B 666B --- 83 damage<br />
 <br />
22_88B w! BS 4K w! Critical Edge ---88 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
66A+B w! 66B BE w! 66B BE --- 89-101 damage, 1 bar meter.<br />
Combo only works if the the 66A+B wallsplats and the first 66B BE re-wall splats, which doesn't always happen.<br />
 <br />
1K w! 1K w! 666B 66B BE 66B BE --- 95 damage, 1 bar meter. Thanks to Esom for this one<br />
 <br />
BS CR/WS B, 4K w! 4K w! 4K, 44K, 2K --- 97 damage, 102 damage on clean hit<br />
 <br />
CH BS 4B, 1K w! 1K w! 66B BE, 66B BE --- 110-112 damage, 1 bar of meter<br />
 <br />
BS CR/WS B, 4K w! 4K w! Critical Edge- 112-114 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
CH BS 4B, 1K, 1K, Critical Edge --- 117 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
It's rare but due to odd angles occassionally the second wallsplat of the combo can miss, and if it does so the opponent can air control out<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Alright, I'm listing this combo separately because the last hit can be teched out of to the left. <br />
 <br />
1K w! 1K w! 666B {B+K} MCHT K --- 76 damage if they lay there and take the last K or if they forward tech.  66 damage if they tech left out of the last hit, but if they tech right or back it's 96-98 damage<br />
 <br />
All wall combos that end with 2K can also be ended with BS 8WR B for virtually identical damage, but 2K is harder to mess up. You might consider BS 8WR B for wake up options, because BS 8WRB ends with Voldo in front turned, and BS 2K leaves him in back turn<br />
 <br />
<b><span style="font-size: large">Counter Hit combos</span></b><br />
 <br />
CH BS 4B, 1K w! 1K w! 66B BE, 66B BE --- 110-112 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
CH BS 4B, 1K w! 1K w! Critical Edge --- 117 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
 <br />
CH BS 4B, Critical Edge --- 125 damage, 1 bar meter<br />
You have to be quick on the timing or you'll only get the first hit of the CE for less than 70 total damage<br />
 <br />
That's all I've really got for now, I'll edit in more later
